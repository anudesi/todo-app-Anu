## MERN-APP 
### TO - DO App

- Full stack application 
- We want to deploy it as one app on heroku in future
- Need to take care of the Structure of  The Application:

    Our Plan is to have our server inside the main MERN-APP folder and client as sub folder inside the MERN-APP folder.
    We need to send the static files when user is accessing our app( because react-build will create a build folder that will contain all of our work as static)

## Functionalities of our App
## Frontend
- Registration with email and password.
- Sign-in
- React-router-dom 
- State Management / Context Api
- axios / fetch


## Backend

-  Basic express server
-  Mongoose Connection
-  Routes
-  Controllers
-  Models
-  Hashing 
-  Authentication / Token creation after verifying email and password
-  Authorization / Token verification
-  Database (Mongodb)
